# VS Code - Gist Theme

This is the VS Code color theme I am using, I made it out of a default Dark Theme, removed some visual clutter, adjusted some code colors and so on. It helps me focus on the code. If you like it, it is available in the marketplace - [Gist Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/gist.gist-theme)
